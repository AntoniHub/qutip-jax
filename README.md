qutip-jax: JAX backend for QuTiP
================================

A plug-in for [QuTiP](https://qutip.org) providing a [JAX](https://github.com/google/jax) linear-algebra backend.
Backing the linear algebra operations with JAX extends QuTiP's
capability to work with a GPU. Furthermore, it allows QuTiP's `Qobj` class to
benefit from [auto differentiation](https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/notebooks/autodiff_cookbook.html).
